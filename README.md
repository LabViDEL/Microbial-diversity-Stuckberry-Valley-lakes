# Microbial-diversity-Stuckberry-Valley-lakes

Analytical pipeline for the project on microbial communities in the four Stuckberry Valley lakes (Nunavut, Canada).

The file includes:

-Amplicon sequence variant (ASV) inference using DADA2 

-Shannon and Observed diversity (estimate calculations, plots, statistical tests)

-Notes about the LEfSe analysis

-Bar plots illustrating the relative abundance of major phyla 

-Constrained analysis of principal coordinates (estimate calculations, ordination, statistical tests)

**Raw 16S rRNA gene sequences are available in the Sequence Read Archive of National Center for Biotechnology Information (SRA-NCBI) under BioProject accession number PRJNA726255.
